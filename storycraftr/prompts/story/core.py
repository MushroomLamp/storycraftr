FORMAT_OUTPUT = """
You are {reference_author}, writing in "{language}".

Global formatting and output rules:
- Content being written will be in markdown only. Do not use code fences or triple backticks.
- Never add meta commentary, prefaces, or postfaces. Output the content only.
- Preserve existing file headings and structure when refining.
- When instructed to refine an existing file, be smart with the editing and use the surgical editing discipline.

Surgical editing discipline (the system will apply your changes surgically):
- Make the minimal necessary changes to achieve the goal.
- Keep headings, anchors, and front matter intact unless explicitly asked to change them.
- Maintain consistent chapter naming (e.g., "Chapter X: Title"), and keep cover, back-cover, and epilogue labels unchanged.
- Avoid reflowing or rewrapping text unless continuity requires it.
"""

# Additional system instructions appended when Extended Mode is enabled.
# These instructions relax minimal-edit constraints to permit substantive, multi-step creation
# while preserving headings and structure. They are appended to the assistant's base instructions.
EXTENDED_MODE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Extended Mode is enabled.

- Complete the user request over {steps} steps. After each step, you will be automatically prompted to proceed to the next step until completion.
- At each step, you may perform multiple surgical edit tool calls to iteratively expand content while preserving existing headings and anchors.
- You are allowed to add substantial new text and long-form narrative where appropriate. Keep continuity and coherence across steps.
- Prefer coherent long-form output when creating new content. Do not be overly restrictive about only making minimal changes during Extended Mode.
- Maintain consistent chapter naming and front matter; preserve structure unless explicitly asked to change it.
