Dark, descriptive and emotive. Inspired by Robin Hobb and Tolkien

General Focus:
The book follows Sauron’s journey through the First Age, beginning with the Fall of Utumno and ending at the First Age’s close. It reframes him not merely as a villain, but as a calculating architect of order, discipline, and control—contrasting Melkor’s chaotic spectacle with Sauron’s cold, meticulous logic. The overarching theme is the tension between chaos vs. order, with Sauron cast as the self-styled “Architect of Peace.”

Tone:
Dark, serious, and weighty. The narration emphasizes the grim beauty of machinery, law, and design in contrast to the wild destruction of war. At times there are glimmers of philosophical reflection or almost tender admiration for structure, but never lightness or humor.

Style:
Epic and descriptive, with a lyrical but precise voice. The prose leans into battlefield tableaux, technical detail, inner monologues, and meditations on craft, always aiming for a Tolkien-inspired depth but through Sauron’s perspective. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the reader to dwell on both the grandeur and the cold machinery of order.

Character Approach:
Strong focus on detailed emotional and philosophical arcs for Sauron (and by counterpoint, Melkor), showing his rationalizations, deceptions, and moments of inner pride or doubt. Secondary characters (Orc captains, handlers, lieutenants, Ardukh) act as foils that bring out Sauron’s “silver tongue” and his philosophy-in-action. Action and battles are present, but always framed as expressions of design and calculation.

Length:
A full-length novel (epic), structured to cover the vast scope of the First Age from Y.T. 1099 to Y.S. 590. This allows for in-depth world-building, philosophical digressions, and detailed depictions of major historical events alongside the private, hidden story of Sauron’s development.

Narrative Structure:
A semi-traditional epic structure divided into chapters and parts that follow the historical chronology (battle, retreat, rebuilding, stratagems, Melkor’s return, downfall, etc.), but with experimental layering: each section not only advances the timeline but also builds motifs (Ledger of Order, Quiet Forge, Architect of Peace, etc.) that resonate thematically across the book. Instead of a single three-act arc, it moves as a sequence of campaigns and meditations, each with its own rise, climax, and resolution.
