Timeline of Sauron’s First Age (from Year of the
Trees 1099 to First Age 590)
The War of the Powers and Sauron’s Escape (Y.T. 1099–1100)
Y.T. 1099 – Fall of Utumno: The Valar overwhelm Melkor’s fortress Utumno in the Battle of the
Powers. As Tulkas wrestles Melkor into chains, Sauron – then the trusted lieutenant of Melkor –
evades capture in the chaos . From Sauron’s perspective, this was a devastating upheaval: the
world he helped build with Melkor was thrown down by the Valar, whom he viewed as invaders.
Rather than surrender, the proud Maia slips into hiding, determined to await a chance to continue
his master’s work.
Y.T. 1100 – Melkor Imprisoned, Sauron Hides: Melkor is dragged in chains to Valinor and sentenced
to three long ages of imprisonment . In Melkor’s absence, Sauron remains at large in Middleearth,
concealing himself in deep, secret places. Far from seeing himself as a “villain,” Sauron
believes he is maintaining order in the way he and Melkor envisioned. During these centuries, he
broods on the Valar’s “tyranny” and resolves to prove his worth. Sauron begins secretly rebuilding
Angband, Melkor’s lesser northern fortress, strengthening its pits and vaults as a future stronghold
. He also expands the breeding of Orcs, ensuring that Melkor’s armies will be ready by the
time of his return . In Sauron’s eyes this is a wise and necessary preparation, not an act of malice
– he tells himself that bringing order to Middle-earth justifies any means.
The Long Vigil in Middle-earth (Y.T. 1100–1495)
Y.T. 1400 – Release of Melkor: After three Ages, Melkor is released from Mandos (the Valar’s prison)
and allowed back into society under watch . Though this happens far away in Aman, Sauron
remains vigilant in Middle-earth, continually shoring up Angband’s defenses. He has had centuries to
reflect on his loyalty and misdeeds. While a spark of fear or regret may have flickered in him,
Sauron’s pride dominates – he does not seek pardon as some of Melkor’s other servants might.
Instead, he awaits his lord’s return, confident that Melkor’s freedom will herald a new rise of
their power. Sauron’s preparations ensure that when Melkor (now named “Morgoth” by the
Noldor) does return, Angband is ready: the furnaces lit, armies of Orcs multiplied, and awful
creatures (such as werewolves and bats) bred in secret .
Y.T. 1495 – The Darkening of Valinor: Events in Valinor now violently reshape Sauron’s world.
Melkor, feigning friendship with the Noldorin Elves, betrays them by destroying the Two Trees with
the aid of the monstrous spider Ungoliant, then murders King Finwë and steals the three Silmarils
. Fleeing back to Middle-earth under a cloak of darkness, Melkor comes with Ungoliant to
Angband, the fortress Sauron has carefully restored. At this moment, Sauron witnesses a dire
confrontation: Ungoliant turns on Melkor, nearly devouring him in her webs of Unlight. Sauron
springs into action alongside the Balrogs, ordering them to strike. In a furious assault of whips and
fire, they drive off Ungoliant and rescue their lord . From Sauron’s perspective, this is a
vindication of his long labors – the stronghold held firm, and he personally helped save Morgoth. He
greets Morgoth back to Angband, now fortified with the three volcanic peaks of Thangorodrim
reared above its gates as a symbol of their defiance . With Morgoth’s return, Sauron rededicates
himself to his master, ready to unleash war upon their enemies.
Morgoth’s Return and the First Battles (Y.T. 1495–1500)
Y.T. 1497 – The First Battle of Beleriand: Wasting little time, Morgoth sends out armies of Orcs to
attack the Elves who remained in Beleriand (the Sindar) before any newcomers arrive. As Morgoth’s
chief lieutenant, Sauron likely oversees strategy. Orc hordes pour into Beleriand, and King Thingol
of Doriath is caught off guard. In this brutal campaign (later called the First Battle of Beleriand), the
woodland Elf-lord Denethor is slain and the Elven havens on the coast are besieged . Sauron
observes that victory is not absolute: Queen Melian of Doriath raises a magical barrier (the Girdle of
Melian) around Thingol’s realm, thwarting the Orcs. Sauron both fears and resents Melian’s power –
as a fellow Maia, she creates an enchanted sanctuary that even his craft cannot breach. The outcome
of the battle is mixed: much of Beleriand is terrorized, but Doriath remains an island of resistance.
Still, Sauron counts this as a strategic win, believing the Sindar will be isolated and weakened.
Y.T. 1497 – Feanor’s Arrival and the Kinslaying: Unbeknownst to Sauron, the Noldor Elves led by
Fëanor have rebelled against the Valar and are en route to Middle-earth, driven by wrath at Morgoth
for murdering Finwë and stealing the Silmarils. That same year, Fëanor’s vanguard lands on the
northern coast. They burn their ships at Losgar, stranding the following host of Fingolfin in the far
north . Sauron watches these fiery beacons from afar with interest – new foes (or potential
pawns) have entered the scene. He knows nothing yet of their internecine strife, but the smoke of
the ship-burnings is a sign that great events are afoot. Sauron likely relays news of these
newcomers to Morgoth; they prepare to test the Noldor’s strength.
Y.T. 1498 – Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle-under-Stars): Fëanor and his Noldor waste no time and
advance toward Angband, slaying the Orc battalions sent against them. Morgoth, seeing this bold
assault, orders an elite force – including Balrogs – to counterattack. In the Battle-under-Stars (Dagornuin-
Giliath), Fëanor is drawn too far forward and is slain by the Balrog lord Gothmog near
Angband’s gates . Sauron does not engage Feanor directly, but he observes the ferocity of this Elf
who briefly shook Angband’s gates. Fëanor’s death is a moment of grim satisfaction for Sauron – one
of the mightiest enemies, who had named Morgoth “Black Foe of the World,” is gone . But the
fight shows Sauron the Noldor are fierce and vengeful. Morgoth attempts a deceitful truce soon
after: he sends an embassy (under a false flag of parley) to treat with Fëanor’s son Maedhros, only
to betray and capture Maedhros in chains . Sauron admires this cunning stratagem; he has
always favored treachery over head-on confrontation. Maedhros is hung upon the heights of
Thangorodrim as a hostage, a living symbol of Morgoth’s triumph .
Y.T. 1500 (First Age Year 1) – The Rising of the Sun: The Valar create the Moon and the Sun first
rises, bringing an end to the Years of Darkness . For Sauron and the creatures of Morgoth, this is
an unwelcome shock. The sudden dawn over Angband is blinding and terrible – sunlight sears the
Orcs, forcing them to cower in shadows. Fingolfin’s host of Noldor, who had crossed the deadly ice of
the north, chooses this moment to arrive in Middle-earth under the new Sun . They come
trumpeting and vengeful, and even ride past Angband’s gates in defiance. Fingolfin’s arrival prompts
the Battle of Lammoth, in which Orcs ambush his vanguard; though Fingolfin’s son Argon is killed,
the Noldor fight their way through . Sauron witnesses Angband’s foes multiply just as daylight
tips the balance against Morgoth’s armies. In his eyes, this “assault” of the new lights is further proof
that the Valar meddle unfairly. Morgoth and Sauron withdraw their forces into fortified shadows, as
the First Age of the Sun begins .
The Siege of Angband and the Long Peace (F.A. 1–455)
F.A. 5 – Rescue of Maedhros: In a daring stroke displaying the Noldor’s resolve, Fingon (Fingolfin’s
son) rides alone to Thangorodrim and rescues Maedhros from captivity, with the aid of the great
eagle Thorondor . Sauron learns that Maedhros, who was supposed to be Morgoth’s prized
prisoner, has escaped. This act has profound consequences: Maedhros, grateful, relinquishes his
claim to kingship and reunites the once-divided Noldor camps . From Angband, Sauron perceives
a troubling development – the Noldor are setting aside their feud and uniting against Morgoth .
Sauron would have preferred his enemies to remain divided and fighting each other. This newfound
Elven unity foreshadows a siege, and indeed the Noldor soon establish watch on Angband.
F.A. 60 – Dagor Aglareb (Glorious Battle): Morgoth probes the strength of the Noldor with a
surprise Orc offensive. Sauron helps coordinate this attack, sending Orc hosts out of Angband’s
gates under cover of darkness. However, the Elves respond swiftly and decisively, utterly defeating
the Orcs and even pursuing them to Angband’s doors . The Dagor Aglareb ends in a rout of
Morgoth’s forces, and in its aftermath the Noldor begin the Siege of Angband, encircling Morgoth’s
realm so no creature can easily escape . For nearly 400 years, Angband is penned in. Sauron
endures this long stalemate, turning to sorcery and subtle weapons since open battle is impossible.
During the siege (often called the Long Peace), Sauron experiments in secret: he breeds
werewolves and fell beasts in the pits of Angband and refines his powers of disguise and
deception. He also acts as Morgoth’s eyes beyond the siege lines by sending out spies (such as
vampires like Thuringwethil). Though mostly trapped, Sauron is patient – he views this peace as
merely a prelude, quietly gathering information on the besieging Elves and the newly arrived Edain
(Men) who have entered Beleriand around F.A. 310 .
F.A. 155 – First Assault on Hithlum: Morgoth occasionally tests the Noldorin siege. One such event
is a bold Orc raid into Hithlum (Fingolfin’s realm) around the year 155 . Sauron helps direct this
thrust, hoping to exploit any weakness. However, Fingon and the Elves utterly defeat the Orc-host in
the north . Morgoth (and Sauron) realize that Orcs alone are no match for the Noldor’s strength
. This lesson is not lost on Sauron – he begins to advise Morgoth to bring forth more formidable
creations. The failure in Hithlum convinces them to deploy a secret weapon long in the making.
F.A. 260 – Glaurung’s First Foray: Sauron stands by Morgoth as they unleash Glaurung, the first of
the Dragons, in a surprise attack on the Elves. Glaurung is a young fire-drake, and when he comes
forth from Angband breathing flame, the Elves initially panic. But Glaurung’s scales had not yet
hardened; a contingent of Elven cavalry led by Fingon charges and drives him back to Angband, to
Morgoth’s great displeasure . Sauron witnesses this setback – a creature meant to break the siege
is instead humbled. Morgoth chastises Glaurung and keeps him in until he matures. Though
frustrated, Sauron takes a long view: each defeat teaches them something. The Long Peace
resumes after Glaurung’s repulse, giving Sauron more time to refine his dark arts. By now he has a
network of spies and servants infiltrating wherever they can beyond the leaguer of Angband.
Crucially, Sauron learns much about Men, who have allied with the Elves. He sees that Men are more
easily swayed or corrupted than Elves, and he stores this insight for future use . (Indeed,
Morgoth later secretly dispatches Sauron or other agents to lure Easterling Men to his service.)
Despite the stasis, Sauron never loses sight of Morgoth’s ultimate plan: to break the Siege and
conquer Beleriand completely.
The Sudden Flame and Aftermath (F.A. 455–465)
F.A. 455 – Dagor Bragollach (Battle of Sudden Flame): At last Morgoth moves to shatter the Siege
of Angband. In a carefully planned assault, rivers of fire erupt from Thangorodrim – blasting
through the leaguer of the Noldor . Sauron plays a key role in this offensive: he directs Orc armies
and other creatures to surge out behind the firestorm. With them comes Glaurung, now full-grown
and more fearsome. The Dagor Bragollach is a triumph for Morgoth – the Elven realms of Ard-galen
(the plains before Angband) are burned black and many Noldorin lords fall in battle . In the
chaos, Sauron sees long-laid schemes come to fruition. The proud Elves are thrown into disarray as
flames and fumes envelop their lands . Sauron’s own power is felt directly for the first time in
centuries: he commands the assault on the isle of Tol Sirion, a strategic watchtower that guards
the pass into central Beleriand. By the next year, his forces conquer it (see 457). Yet even in this hour
of victory, the enemy’s valor surprises him – Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, in wrath rides alone
to Angband and challenges Morgoth to single combat. From the battlements, Sauron watches
anxiously as Morgoth himself emerges to fight Fingolfin. The duel is intense: Fingolfin wounds
Morgoth seven times before being slain, and Morgoth’s cries echo in Angband . Though Fingolfin
dies, Sauron is shaken by the encounter – it showed that even Morgoth can be hurt by the nobility of
the Children of Ilúvatar. Morgoth, now limping from his wounds, retires into the depths of
Angband and leaves more of the day-to-day war leadership to Sauron . At this time Morgoth also
begins plotting to bring Men (the Easterlings) into Beleriand as his allies, a task Sauron assists with
from afar.
F.A. 456–457 – Sauron Captures Tol Sirion: Capitalizing on the Sudden Flame offensive, Sauron
leads a host of wolves and fell beasts to seize the isle of Tol Sirion, where Finrod Felagund had built
a great watchtower (Minas Tirith). The fortress blocks the road between north and south Beleriand,
so taking it is key to Morgoth’s strategy. Sauron’s assault is swift and terror falls on Orodreth (Finrod’s
brother) who commands the tower. In F.A. 457, Minas Tirith is conquered by Sauron . Sauron
seats himself in the tower and perverts it into a place of dread, earning himself the name Lord of
Werewolves. Tol Sirion becomes Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of Werewolves, as Sauron populates it with
dreadful wolves, vampires, and other creatures of the night . This is a personal triumph for
Sauron – it is his own mini-kingdom under Morgoth’s supremacy, and from here he can directly
threaten the Elves in Beleriand’s heartlands. Sauron exults in spreading fear: an “evil breathing”
emanates from Tol-in-Gaurhoth that blights the land for leagues. From this fortress, Sauron surveys
the aftermath of Bragollach. He sends out spies and raiding parties to hunt down the last pockets of
resistance, particularly in the wilds of Dorthonion which have fallen under Morgoth’s control.
F.A. 458–460 – The Death of Barahir’s Outlaw Band: In Dorthonion, one last group of Elf-friends
fights a guerrilla campaign against Morgoth: the band of Barahir. Morgoth, enraged by their deeds,
orders Sauron to exterminate them . Sauron employs his signature cunning for this task. One of
Barahir’s men, Gorlim, is captured and brought before Sauron. Sauron deceives Gorlim with false
promises – he feigns mercy and offers Gorlim a reunion with his (deceased) wife Eilinel if he betrays
Barahir’s hideout . Under the terror of Sauron’s gaze, Gorlim yields and gives away the outlaws’
location . Sauron then coldly reveals his trick: Eilinel was long dead, and Gorlim is slain once his
usefulness is spent . Armed with this intelligence, Sauron’s forces fall upon Barahir’s camp at Tarn
Aeluin. Barahir and his companions are massacred in 460, all except Barahir’s son Beren who is
away and thus survives . When Sauron learns of Beren’s escape, he is vexed – Beren becomes a
lone outlaw, elusive and furious at his father’s murder. Sauron sets a bounty on Beren and
commands werewolves and Orcs to hunt him relentlessly . Though Beren evades capture
(fleeing eventually into Doriath), Sauron takes grim satisfaction in having wiped out most of Barahir’s
rebels. These events showcase Sauron’s cruelty and cunning: from his point of view, he has simply
eliminated a band of insurgents by outwitting them, an efficient act toward securing Morgoth’s
order in Beleriand .
F.A. 463–465 – The Shadow of Lúthien’s Quest: In these years, rumors reach Sauron’s ears of
something curious: Beren, the hunted outlaw, has trespassed into Doriath and won the love of
Lúthien, King Thingol’s daughter. While Sauron is busy conducting Morgoth’s war (skirmishes
continue across Beleriand and Easterling Men enter the scene, swearing loyalty to Maedhros even as
spies for Morgoth ), he remains alert to any threat. By 465, Beren and King Finrod Felagund of
Nargothrond set out on a quest – none other than to steal a Silmaril from Morgoth’s crown. Although
Sauron does not yet know their aim, he senses a company of strangers moving through his
territory in disguise. His servants report suspicious Orcs passing near Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Sauron, ever
vigilant over his new domain, intercepts this band.
F.A. 465 – Sauron Defeats Finrod and Captures Beren: Beren, Finrod, and ten companions are
traveling north in Orc-costumes when Sauron’s spies spot them entering the valley near Tol-in-
Gaurhoth . Sauron, being cunning and paranoid, knows that all Orc troops in the area are
supposed to report to him at the isle – these newcomers do not. He stops them and has them
seized . Brought before Sauron, the captives do not divulge their identities, so Sauron decides to
unveil them by force. He contends with Finrod Felagund in a duel of songs of power – a mighty
contest of sorcery and will. Though Finrod is a son of Finarfin and powerful in his own right, Sauron’s
might in sorcery is greater; one by one he overcomes Finrod’s defenses, chanting of darkness until
their disguises fall away . Stripped of pretense, Beren and Finrod are flung into Sauron’s
dungeon. Unable to discern their exact mission, Sauron opts for a slow, cruel interrogation: he
throws the twelve captives into a pit and sends werewolves to devour them one by one .
Sauron’s aim is to break their spirits and extract their plan. Over days of horror, the werewolf kills the
companions until only Beren and Finrod remain, chained in darkness . Finally, a great werewolf is
sent to finish Beren – and at this moment Finrod finds his chance at redemption. The Elf-king
summons his last reserve of strength and breaks his bonds, pouncing on the wolf bare-handed. In a
savage fight Finrod slays the wolf, saving Beren, but he himself is mortally wounded and dies in
Beren’s arms . Sauron senses the death of Finrod from his tower and is robbed of a prisoner of
great value. He is furious – not only did he lose the opportunity to learn Finrod’s secrets, but Finrod’s
valor denies him total victory. Still, he has Beren left alive, whom he suspects now to be an outlaw
of note (possibly the notorious Beren son of Barahir). Sauron plans to torment Beren and extract
what he knows about this quest. At this moment, however, a greater power intervenes.
F.A. 466 – Lúthien and Huan Overthrow Sauron: Lúthien Tinúviel comes to rescue Beren,
accompanied by Huan, the legendary Hound of Valinor. Sauron, peering from the tower of Minas
Tirith (Tol-in-Gaurhoth), spots Lúthien approaching and is astonished – this is the daughter of Melian
and Thingol, whose beauty and fame are known even to him . Sauron lusts to capture Lúthien,
thinking to deliver this valuable prize to Morgoth . He sends wolves to fetch her, but one by one
Huan, the great wolf-hound, slays them at the bridge . Sauron ups the ante by dispatching
Draugluin, the sire of all his werewolves. When even Draugluin is slain by Huan (perishing after
whispering to Sauron that Huan is there) , Sauron decides to personally enter the fray. He
assumes the form of a gigantic werewolf – the greatest wolf that ever walked Arda – and
attacks . So terrible is his onslaught that even Huan is thrown back momentarily and Lúthien
almost swoons. But Lúthien calls upon her own power inherited from Melian: as Sauron leaps at her,
she casts a mantle of enchanted sleep and darkness over him, robbing his eyes of sight and filling
his limbs with weariness . Huan seizes this chance and pounces on wolf-Sauron, and a titanic
battle ensues. The fëa (spirit) of Sauron is strong; he shifts shape from wolf to serpent to his own
visage in desperation, but Huan’s grip cannot be broken . Sauron is caught, howling in pain.
Lúthien gives Sauron a choice: surrender or be destroyed. For the first time in this age, Sauron
submits to an enemy. He yields Tol-in-Gaurhoth to Lúthien and Huan in exchange for his life .
Humbled utterly, Sauron flees in disgrace – he takes the form of a vampire bat, “dripping blood
from his throat” in horror, and escapes to the wilderness of Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion) . This
defeat is a defining moment for Sauron. From his perspective it is a bitter, humiliating setback: not
only has he lost his island fortress and allowed his prisoners to slip away, but he was personally
bested by an Elf-maiden and a hound. Sauron’s self-image as an unbeatable deceiver is badly
dented. Nursed by hatred and shame, he retreats into the shadows to recover his strength. He does
not return to Morgoth’s throne for some time, unwilling to report such a failure. For the remainder of
the First Age, Sauron haunts the dark forests in vampire form, a shadow of his former terror – and
he avoids any direct confrontation with the Children of Ilúvatar. (Notably, he does not participate
openly in the next great battle, the Nirnaeth.) In his bitterness, Sauron undoubtedly tells himself that
Lúthien’s victory was a fluke, achieved only by magical arts and the one creature (Huan) fated to
defeat him. Nevertheless, he has been unmasked as vulnerable, and this lesson will inform his
cunning in ages to come.
The Fall of the Free Kingdoms (F.A. 472–510)
F.A. 472 – Nirnaeth Arnoediad (Battle of Unnumbered Tears): Morgoth, having recovered from
the setback with Beren and Lúthien, now turns to destroying the remaining alliances of Elves and
Men. Though Sauron is still keeping a low profile after his defeat, he contributes to Morgoth’s plans
through intelligence and deceit. Morgoth gathers a colossal army and, through spies and traitorous
Men, learns of the Union of Maedhros – an alliance of Elven kingdoms and Edain planning to attack
Angband. Sauron undoubtedly aids in sowing distrust and misinformation, helping Morgoth lure
the coalition into a trap. At Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Morgoth’s forces feign weakness to draw the allies
in; then Morgoth releases his full might: legions of Orcs, wolf-riders, Balrogs, dragons (Glaurung now
at full power), and corrupt Men (the Easterlings). Crucially, the Easterlings led by Uldor turn traitor
in the midst of battle, stabbing the alliance in the back at the decisive moment . Sauron’s
fingerprints are on this treachery – it was Morgoth’s command to corrupt these Men, something
Sauron had long prepared. The result is catastrophic for the Elves and Edain: the High King Fingon is
killed, Huor is killed, and Húrin is captured after fighting valiantly to cover Turgon’s retreat .
Virtually all the great houses of the Noldor are defeated or scattered. Morgoth achieves total
victory, and his triumph is so complete the day is named Unnumbered Tears. From afar (likely from
Taur-nu-Fuin or back in Angband’s deepest pits), Sauron savors this moment. The humiliation of Tolin-
Gaurhoth is redeemed in blood. With the hosts of Angband swarming freely over Beleriand,
Sauron sees his master’s dominion nearly achieved. Secretly, he prides himself on the role his
deceptions played: Morgoth’s use of lies and spies – very much Sauron’s style – ensured the alliance’s
downfall. In Sauron’s mind, this vindicates his belief that cunning and betrayal are stronger than
valor.
F.A. 473 – The Sack of the Falas: Following the Nirnaeth victory, Morgoth sends forces to mop up
the remaining resistance. The coastal havens of the Falas (Brithombar and Eglarest), ruled by Círdan,
are besieged and overrun . While Gothmog and dragons took front stage in Nirnaeth, Sauron
may have coordinated these follow-up assaults in Morgoth’s name. The Falathrim havens are
burned, and refugees flee to the Isle of Balar . Sauron regards the fall of the Falas as another
step in eradicating hope from Middle-earth. Notably, the survivors include Gil-galad and Círdan, who
escape by sea – an annoyance Sauron notes but cannot prevent. After this, Morgoth’s tyranny is
almost unchallenged. Only a few hidden enclaves like Gondolin and Doriath remain unconquered
(and Doriath’s safety owes to Melian’s magic, which Sauron loathes but cannot counter). Sauron,
perhaps now restored to Morgoth’s councils, strides through conquered lands as a dread
lieutenant once more, setting up puppet governors (often Easterling chieftains) over the
subjugated Edain and hunting any fugitive Elves. He likely oversees the cruel occupation of Hithlum
by Easterlings, ensuring the House of Hador’s folk are enslaved and can pose no threat. His presence
is a shadow of fear across Beleriand’s wreckage.
F.A. 495 – The Fall of Nargothrond: Although Sauron is not directly involved in the tragic tale of
Túrin Turambar, he witnesses the consequences of Morgoth’s malice playing out. In 495, Morgoth
unleashes Glaurung to attack Nargothrond, aided indirectly by Túrin’s missteps. The great
underground Elven fortress falls to the dragon. From Angband, Sauron views this as another win:
one of the last Elven strongholds is destroyed and its treasures plundered. Sauron has a personal
interest here too – Finrod Felagund, whom he slew years before, founded Nargothrond. Its ruin by
Glaurung almost feels like belated revenge completed for Sauron (though Finrod was already gone).
Moreover, Morgoth captures Húrin’s family in these events (Nienor, Túrin’s sister-wife, meets a
dreadful end due to Glaurung). Sauron, who remembers Húrin from Nirnaeth (Morgoth keeps Húrin
chained on a chair on Angband’s walls), delights in how utterly Morgoth is breaking the House of
Hador’s line. With Nargothrond gone, only Doriath and Gondolin remain as significant free realms.
F.A. 506 – The Ruin of Doriath: Morgoth’s evil indirectly causes Doriath – the enchanted kingdom
Sauron could never enter – to fall as well. The cursed Silmaril that Beren and Lúthien took from
Morgoth’s crown eventually comes to Doriath and sparks tragedy. Dwarves from Nogrod murder
King Thingol over it, and later Fëanor’s sons (Celegorm’s surviving brothers) attack Doriath’s
survivors, slaying Dior Thingol’s heir and his family . Though Morgoth’s armies are not involved,
Sauron observes from afar that strife over the Silmaril accomplished what Angband could not:
Doriath is left in ruin, Melian departs, and the girdle of protection is gone. Sauron undoubtedly finds
grim amusement that the curse of the Silmarils – jewels forged by Elves – has led Elves and
Dwarves to destroy each other, doing Morgoth’s work for him. Now no magical fence shields any
Elven realm, and Sauron considers Doriath’s fall a moral victory for Morgoth’s long vengeance on
Thingol and Melian.
F.A. 510 – The Fall of Gondolin: The hidden city of Gondolin, long the greatest thorn in Morgoth’s
side, is betrayed from within by Maeglin and assaulted by Morgoth’s forces. Balrogs and dragons
sack the city in a night of horror, and King Turgon perishes. Although Sauron was not present (the
assault was led by Gothmog and dragons), he surely exults when news reaches Angband that
Gondolin has been wiped out. Now every fortress of the Eldar in Beleriand is destroyed; no
organized force is left to challenge Morgoth. A few survivors of Gondolin (like Tuor, Idril, and the
child Eärendil) flee south to the mouths of Sirion, joining remnants of Doriath – but these are
refugees, not armies. By the early 510s, Morgoth’s triumph over Beleriand is absolute. Sauron, as
Morgoth’s deputy, shares in the domination of the miserable remnants of Beleriand. He likely
oversees large swathes of territory as Morgoth’s regent, enforcing Morgoth’s cruel policies and
hunting remaining fugitive leaders (he surely wishes to recapture Elwing and the Silmaril she bears,
after the Second Kinslaying in 509–510, but Elwing escapes over sea). In Sauron’s view, the First Age
is ending in complete victory for his side – a victory he worked long to achieve. Perhaps only one
disquieting sign troubles him: there are whispers that Eärendil the half-Elf has sailed to seek the aid
of the Valar in the uttermost West. Sauron, remembering the wrath of the Valar from long ago,
might harbor a sliver of worry at this news, but Morgoth scoffs at it. After all, Morgoth now calls
himself King of the World; the Valar have left Middle-earth to his rule for centuries. Sauron bolsters
his master’s confidence (and his own) with the thought that no army from Aman could possibly
unseat them now, especially with the Silmarils still in Morgoth’s iron crown. And yet, they are soon
proved wrong.
The War of Wrath and Sauron’s Judgment (F.A. 545–590)
F.A. 545 – The Host of Valinor Arrives: To Sauron’s dismay, the Valar do respond to Eärendil’s plea.
In 545, the Host of Valinor – an army of Maiar and Elves of Aman led by Eönwë, the herald of Manwë
– lands in Beleriand to confront Morgoth . The great War of Wrath begins, the likes of which Arda
has never seen. Morgoth, caught unprepared by the might of Aman, calls upon all his servants.
Sauron is at his master’s side and now must face the very powers he fled ages ago. He dreads the
strength of the Valar’s host, yet as Morgoth’s lieutenant he coordinates the defense. He directs
innumerable legions of Orcs and wolves into battle and helps unleash new terrors: winged dragons
– Morgoth’s last weapons – which burst from Angband in a desperate counter-stroke late in the war.
The conflict rages for roughly 40 years, devastating Beleriand (whole regions are broken and
swallowed by the sea) . Sauron’s perspective during this war is fraught with fear and fury. He
remembers how Utumno fell in the First War and is determined to avoid capture this time. He fights
with all his guile, using sorcery and strategies of deception to harry the western host. At times the
tide seems to favor Angband – for instance, the great dragon Ancalagon almost scatters the
Valinorean fleet – but one by one Morgoth’s last titans fall. In the final battles (F.A. 587), Ancalagon
the Black is slain and the Thangorodrim towers are destroyed . The Two Silmarils that Morgoth
still held are taken by Eönwë. Morgoth’s forces are utterly spent; all Balrogs save possibly a couple
are eliminated, and Orcs are destroyed en masse . With Angband overrun and ruin all around,
Morgoth is at last taken captive by the host of Valinor . For Sauron, this moment is one of
existential crisis: his god and master, whom he worshipped since the beginning, is thrown down.
Everything he worked for in the First Age – all the victories and dominions – collapse into dust as
Morgoth is bound with the chain Angainor once again.
F.A. 587 – Sauron’s (Feigned) Repentance: In the immediate aftermath of Morgoth’s defeat, a
dazed Sauron comes forth to Eönwë, the herald of Manwë. Knowing that he cannot hope to fight
the Maia of the Valar, Sauron cloaks himself in a fair visage – perhaps appearing as the majestic
figure he once was as Mairon of Aulë – and he humbles himself. Before Eönwë, Sauron prostrates
and renounces all evil he has done . Those who witness this say that at first his repentance
seems genuine, at least on the surface . Indeed, in this hour Sauron is filled with terror at the
wrath of the Lords of the West and the prospect of punishment. One might say that Sauron truly is
afraid and wishes he could undo his crimes – though notably, it is fear of consequences that drives
him, not true moral regret . Eönwë, however, informs Sauron that as a Maia, he cannot pardon
him on the spot; Sauron must travel to Aman to face the judgment of Manwë and the Valar .
This causes a sharp turn in Sauron’s heart. He is proud and incapable of bearing humiliation. Sauron
knows that if he goes to Valinor he will be at the Valar’s mercy, perhaps sentenced to ages of
servitude or imprisonment for redemption . The prospect of abject humiliation – being a
repentant servant in the very courts he once scorned – is something his pride will not allow. In
his mind, he rationalizes that he did try to repent, and if the Valar won’t simply forgive him on his
terms, he’d rather take his chances elsewhere.
F.A. 590 – Sauron Chooses to Disappear: When Eönwë and the victorious Host of Valinor march
back home, taking Morgoth captive and banishing him beyond the world into the Void , they
summon all servants of Morgoth to surrender. But Sauron is nowhere to be found. Ashamed and
unwilling to submit to further judgment, Sauron flees into hiding . He likely slips away just as
the Host is departing Middle-earth, avoiding a final command to accompany them. In the words of
the chroniclers: “Sauron was ashamed, and unwilling to return in humiliation… Therefore, when
Eönwë departed, he hid himself in Middle-earth” . In this act, Sauron falls back into evil – he
rejects the faint impulse of repentance and doubles down on his own path, forsaking any mercy .
To Sauron’s mind, freedom (even in skulking obscurity) is preferable to chained servitude in Valinor.
He has always believed in dominating rather than being dominated, and he cannot accept a role of
penitence. Thus ends the First Age: Morgoth is gone forever, and Beleriand lies in ruin under the sea
. Sauron survives as the chief evildoer left in Middle-earth. Though the Second Age dawns
without Morgoth’s shadow, Sauron remains in the dark places of the world, nursing his ambition. He
still does not think himself the “villain” – in his eyes, he should now become the order-bringer that
Morgoth failed to be. As the First Age closes, Sauron begins pondering new strategies to bring the
world under his just and efficient rule, setting the stage for the rise of the second Dark Lord in the
ages to come .
