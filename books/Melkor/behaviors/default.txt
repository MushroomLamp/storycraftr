Title: Melkor
Genre: High Fantasy
Tone: Dark, introspective, and morally ambiguous
Main Themes: Power, control, manipulation, creation
Narrative Focus: The story should focus heavily on internal character conflicts and the moral consequences of actions. It’s a character-driven story with a gradual unfolding of a manipulative protagonist’s plan.
Protagonist Approach: The protagonist is morally gray, often manipulative, and ruthlessness. Depict the world as hostile, unforgiving, and filled with complex characters who reflect this.
Pacing and Length: The story should be a single book, mid-length (250-300 pages), with interesting tensions and releases. Include detailed worldbuilding but keep the focus on character development and power dynamics.

The story should be told from the perspective of Melkor, narrated in 3rd person.
